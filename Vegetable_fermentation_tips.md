Underlying unity to vegetable fermentation: Keep vegetables submerged under liquid - selective environment where moulds 
and other oxygen-dependent organisms cannot grow and encourage acidifying bacteria.

Other than that, most fermentation can take place anywhere, and however deemed fit.

Fermentation of raw vegetables is one of the oldest and safest techniques around, and is considered safer than eating 
raw vegetables. In the case where there is contamination, pathogenic bacteria cannot compete with native lactic acid 
bacteria populations, and acidity will destroy all other competing pathogens.

**Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB)**

Are found on all plants, but averaging below 1% of the plant's microbial populations. But as soon as plant is harvested, 
the number of microorganisms increases due to there being more nutrients from the ruptured tissue. Distribution of microbes
also changes.

If vegetables are submerged, L. mesenteroides initiate fermentation. These microbes are heterofermentative, and in 
addition to its primary product lactic acid, secondary products like carbon dioxide, alcohol and acetic acid is generated. 

Heterofermentative LAB bacteria are those that produce at least 85% of the lactic acid in the fermented products.
These bacteria are more specialised and are better able to tolerate high acidity conditions. They also are the ones
responsible for the high CO2 production at the earlier stages of veg fermentation.

As the environment in the fermenting vegetables acidifies, the population shifts towards homofermentative bacteria at the
later stages of production, and these 2 populations thrive in a symbiotic relationship.

LAB has self-protecting properties, and the lactic acid they produce is effective in inhibiting other types of bacteria
that decompose or spoil the food.

**Vit C and fermented vegetables**

Preservation of vegetables is so widespread because historically, there were no fresh vegetables available in winter.
This was a strategy to extend the season for consumption of vegetables in winter.

Fermented vegetables contain many nutrients, including Vitamin C, crucial to a balanced diet in winter months.

Although it does not increase Vitamin C in the produce, it preserves existing Vitamin C in the vegetables by slowing down
its loss. Vitamin C is only lost after the fermentation process, due to the lack of a protective barrier/atmosphere of
carbon dioxide.

**How the writer preserves vegetables**

* Chop/grate vegetables
* Lightly salt the chopped vegetables, and pound/squeeze till moist. Alternatively, soak vegetables in brine 
solution for a few hours.
* Pack vegetables in a jar or other vessel tightly, so that they are forced beneath the liquid. Add water if necessary.
Wait, taste, and enjoy!
* **In essence: CHOP, SALT, PACK, WAIT!**

**Chopping**

Not necessary, vegetables can be fermented in chunks. But chopping them creates more surface area, 
which facilitates pulling out their individual juices so they can be submerged in them. The more finely chopped they are,
the easier it is to pull out the juices. But it's your choice.

**Salt: Dry-Salting vs Brining**

Salting not necessary.

BUT: Salt allows vegetables to taste better, have a more pleasing texture, and ferment longer and more slowly.

Salt slows fermentation and enzyme activity and prolongs preservation potential. Fermentation is slower in cool conditions.
Therefore he uses more salt during summer months to slow fermentation.

Not all salts are the same. Works with unrefined sea salt, made bioavailabe by fermentation. 

Avoid iodised salts, darken vegetables and make brine cloudy.

Pounding or squeezing vegetables

Bruising them after the first two processes help remove water, better able to submerge them under their own juices.

On a smaller scale, can simply squeeze vegetables with your own hands. Can also stomp on them in a large scale.

In Asian traditions, people usually wilt them in brine over time. Drain before mixing with spices.

**Pack**

Thereafter, they can be further salted or spiced, and packed into vessels.

Make sure vegetables are fully submerged; remove all air bubbles and pack tightly.

Keep pressing, or leave vegetables out under a weight for a few hours, and more water will come out.

If vegetable cannot be fully submerged, add a little dechlorinated water. Full submersion is the most critical part.
Vegetables tend to float in a salty brine environment. Add something to weigh it down. Can be a cabbage heart, or a 
chunk of root vegetable, or anything else.

The fermentation process will produce CO2, so release pressure daily for the first few days, simply by loosening the lid for 
a moment. After the first few days, production of CO2 will slow down.

**How long to ferment?**

No definite time, taste at intervals, but generally the longer the better. People used to do this over a season.

Depends on how you would like it to taste.

Lower temperatures, around 15 degrees Celsius are ideal. Ferment very slowly, but kraut produced will be of superior 
quality and have longer shelve lives than those fermented at higher temperatures.

Lactic acid bacteria usually follow a bell curve: rapidly increases when first fermented, build to a peak, and then
decline at higher levels of acidity. Types of bacteria also shifts as fermentation proceeds. Writer thinks that fermenting 
vegetables are best eaten throughout the fermentation process, so that one can diversify their bacteria exposure.

In cool areas like refrigerators and cellars, fermentation, can go on for years at a stable rate.

In warmer temperatures, fermentation not quite as stable because pectin-digesting bacteria will activate and cause the
fermentation to get mushy.

**Surface moulds and yeasts**

Can be removed, and will not ruin fermented vegetables.

During fermentation, a layer of yeasts may develop on the surface (can also change into mould). 

A thick, folded layer of yeasts, known as Kahm yeast.

Beige in colour with dramatic texture. Do not have to distinguish between surface moulds and yeats; they should all be 
removed.

But as long as the mould is white it is not harmful; bright colours indicates sporification- and these types of moulds are
generally easily removed.

Don't let moulds ferment for too long on the surface-they can digest the pectin and turn the vegetables mushy. 
Eventually the vegetables taste like mould. They can also digest lactic acid, leading to lowering the acidity needed for 
them to be effectively preserved.

To prevent this, prevent the surface from coming in contact with air. Some people cover it with olive oil, used/unwanted
cabbage parts, or plastic bags.

Keep vegetables submerged, and remove those that have become dried and mouldy.

**Which vegetables can be fermented?**

Not all vegetables will taste good when fermented.

Avoid fermenting dark green veg, strong characteristic flavour. Eg Kale

Most popular vegetables to ferment are cold-weather vegetables that are harvested late into the season as the temperatures 
are cooling.

Preferably ferment raw foods, because cooked foods usually have less LAB. But can ferment cooked foods with raw ones as 
starters.

start a fresh batch rather than fermenting old with new ones.
