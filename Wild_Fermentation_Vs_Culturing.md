**Wild Fermentation Versus Culturing**

Substrates and Microbial Communities: The food we are fermenting is known in the literature as the substrate.

The practice of fermentation largely consists of manipulating environmental conditions to encourage certain organisms 
and discourage others By excluding air, we make it impossible for molds to grow on the vegetables, 
which has the effect of encouraging lactic acid bacteria.
 
Kefir is a vivid example of this. Kefir “grains” or “curds” are rubbery blobs, polysaccharides inhabited by a community of 
some 30 distinct bacterial and fungal species. The organisms coordinate their reproduction and spin their shared skin.
 
And although these biological creations developed out of daily human interaction with milk, it is not possible to 
create a kefir grain from scratch. They reproduce in the nutritive medium of milk, and kefir begets kefir.
 
This type of starter, evolved into a stable biological entity, is known as a symbiotic community of bacteria and yeast, 
or SCOBY.
 
In order to maintain a culture over time, you must feed it regularly.
 
**WILD FERMENTATION VERSUS LACTO-FERMENTATION VERSUS CULTURING**
 
Wild fermentation specifically describes a spontaneous fermentation
 
A wild fermentation is often a lacto-fermentation as well, but not always. Alternatively, a wild fermentation could 
also be an alcohol fermentation, an acetic acid fermentation, an alkaline fermentation, or (frequently) mixed.
 
Culturing usually means that a microbial starter of some has been introduced.


**Community Evolution and Succession**
Microbial communities are dynamic and always shifting.
 
Yet in some cases they exhibit extraordinary stability over time. “Compounds made by a mixture of microorganisms often complement each other and work to the exclusion of unwanted microorganisms,”

The many advantages of mixed-culture fermentation starters, they “can be maintained indefinitely by unskilled people 
with a minimum of training.”
Fermentation communities possess an internal balance among community members, Traditional yogurt cultures; for instance, can be perpetuated for generations, with proper care.


**Cleanliness and Sterilization**

A clean surface, one that is free of visible dirt, is obtained by washing.


A sanitary surface, which is obtained by washing or spraying with a sanitizing or disinfectant solution, is free from most or 
all microorganisms, toxins, and other unhealthy substances.
A sterile surface or substance, obtained by sterilization (as by pressure cooking, washing with alcohol, or heating in a 
flame), is completely free of living organisms.
 
But generally sterilization is unnecessary. Incidental microorganisms that inevitably are found in non-sterile though 
clean environments cannot generally gain a foothold in a fermentation substrate.


**Cross-Contamination**

My short answer to this question is that while different cultures may subtly influence one another through the air over time, 
typically this is not an issue.


**Water**

The biggest problem with water is the presence of chlorine.
Chlorine is added to municipal water supplies specifically to kill microorganisms. If you add heavily chlorinated water 
into mixtures you wish to ferment, you may find that the chlorine prevents fermentation altogether, or slows, changes, 
or inhibits it.

Boil the water in an open pot; the chlorine will evaporate. The only drawback of this method is that you need to cool the water down to body temperature before you can add it into a mixture that contains the live cultures we are trying to encourage.


**Salt**
Standard table salt in the United States has iodine added, to replace the iodine and other minerals stripped out of it, 
as well as various chemical anti-caking agents.

Since iodine has antimicrobial properties, and the anti-caking agents can cause darkening and cloudiness, some of the literature suggests avoiding standard table salt for fermentation.
 
The usual alternative suggestion is to use pickling, canning, or kosher salts, which do not contain iodine.
 
Lactic acid bacteria seem tolerant to a wide variety of salts, including iodized table salt, and are not particularly picky.
 
In most ferments, including vegetables, salting can be done to taste, without any need for measuring.
 
**Brine method**
5 percent weight of water,* or roughly 3 tablespoons/quart
For quick reference, water weighs approximately 2 pounds per quart/1 kg per liter

**Darkness and Sunlight**
Fermentation is generally practiced protected from direct sunlight
Some traditions of cucumber pickling, often the rationale is that the sunlight, hitting the surface of the ferment directly,
prevents surface molds and thus creates an advantageous selective environment.
