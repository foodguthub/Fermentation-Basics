 
Microbial composition of fermented foods
3 major groups of microorganisms: Bacteria, Yeasts and Fungi
 
- Bacteria: Significant role in production of fermented foods, and also found in the end products. Most significantly: Lactic Acid bacteria.
- Yeasts: yeast food fermentation is practiced around the world along with bacterial and fungal fermentation or in combination.
- Fungi: production of enzymes and degradation of anti-nutritive factors
 
Importance of microorganisms in fermented foods
Health benefits due to functional microorganisms
 
- Biotransformation of bland foods
        	- Eg Japanese cuisine, bland vegetable proteins into meat-flavoured sauces
- Biological preservation
        	- improves microbiological safety of foods without refrigeration by using lactic acid fermentation
- Biological enhancement of nutritional value of food
        	- Food substrates enriched biologically with essential amino acids and vitamins
- Biodegradation of undesirable compounds
        	- Removes toxins and anti-nutritive properties of foods so they become edible, with enhanced aroma and flavour.
- Bioimprovement of lactose metabolism
        	- alleviates symptoms of lactose intolerance
- Probiotic properties
        	- Stabilises the digestive system and stimulates immune system, even purports to prevent cancer.
- Bio-production of enzymes
        	- breaks down complex compounds into simple biomolecules for eg, industrial use.
- Antimicrobial properties
        	- to make food safe to eat.
- Medicinal value
        	- improves the human immune system for prevention and treatment of diseases such as cancer.
 
Biochemical identification to identify bacteria in fermented foods
Biochemical tests are based on the metabolic activities of the bacteria:
- Carbon dioxide and nitrogen sources
- Energy sources
- Sugar fermentation
- Secondary metabolites function (by-product of the fermentation)
- Enzyme and toxin production
 
One widely used method is API (Analytical Profile Index) system. The test strips enable the determination of the fermentative abilities of different carbohydrates by an isolated strain.
Other systems for identification: (mostly through liquid and gas chromatography and redox reactions+ visualisation software)
- Rapid API-ZYM System
- Biolog system
-DNA analysis
- etc
 
Also culture-independent techniques
for unculturable microorganisms (a direct PCR-DGGE analysis)
