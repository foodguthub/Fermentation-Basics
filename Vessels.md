**Fermentation Vessels**

A glass jar will suffice as a vessel for most ferments.
 
* Differently shaped vessels offer different functional benefits and challenges. For a solid food, like sauerkraut, 
a wide mouth is important, wide enough to get your hand or a tool inside.

* For aerobic processes such as making kombucha or vinegar, in which the fermentation is most active at the surface 
where access to oxygen is greatest, you also want a wide vessel. Once wines or meads are vigorously bubbling, if you 
wish to ferment to dryness, move them to narrow-necked vessels, fairly full, with an air lock, so as to minimize surface 
area where aerobic vinegar production could occur.

**Jar Method**

If you seal a jar containing an active ferment, the pressure may build from the production of CO2. With yogurt you need 
not be concerned, but if you ferment vegetables or beverages in a sealed jar, you usually need to release pressure, or 
it can build to the point where jars explode.
 
Alternatively, you can place the lid loosely on the jar so that pressure will be released.
 
If an acidic ferment sits for a long period in a jar with a metallic lid, the lid may corrode.
 
Bail-top clamped jars for fermenting vegetables: These are jars with glass tops held down by levered wire clasps, with rubber
gaskets to assure a tight seal.
 
As the food ferments, pressure builds up inside the closed bottle. When the pressure inside is greater than it is outside, 
the gasket will release either the gas, or brine from inside the jar. But, it does not allow anything from outside the
container to come back inside. In effect, a gas seal will be created so that even if the brine level falls below the
level of the vegetables, there is no mold or spoilage inside the bottle. Once you seal the bottle to begin the fermentation, 
DO NOT open it again, until you are ready to eat.


**Crock Method**

For fermenting at a larger scale, ceramic crocks are generally used.
Old crocks might cause lead leaching into food from old glazes.

Crock Lids

A crock may or may not have a lid; or may, in fact, have two.
If you use rocks, be sure to use hard smooth ones that are not limestone, which can dissolve in an acidic environment.
 
Flies landing on your ferments can result in maggots crawling out a few days later
 
Fill a plastic bag with water and let that serve as both weight and lid. Gravity forces the water enclosed in the flexible plastic to spread and cover the full surface of the fermenting food, effectively cutting off air access.
To avoid water leaking into the ferment and diluting it, use a thick plastic or multiple layers. Some people fill the bag with brine, in case it leaks into the vegetables.
Functionally, this is an excellent solution; the only drawback is that it brings the food into prolonged contact with plastic, discussed ahead in Plastic Vessels.


Different Crock Designs

The Korean tradition of ceramic fermentation crocks is called onggi.
there is no single method or vessel or style for fermenting.

**Metal Vessels**

In general, it is best to avoid fermenting in metallic containers.

**Plastic Vessels**

Plastic can be functionally effective for fermentation, but it also has its drawbacks
 
Plastic vessels are the chemicals that may leach from the plastic into your fermenting food or beverage.
 
The concentration of phthalates in the contents of PET bottles varies as a function of the contents of the bottle, 
with phthalates leaching into lower pH products such as soda and vinegar more readily than into bottled water.

**Wooden Vessels**

For large-scale fermentation, wooden barrels make excellent vessels.
Wood grains definitely harbor microbes, but lactic acid bacteria on all vegetables easily dominate the protected environment under the brine.

**Alternative fermentation vessels**

Gourds

Baskets (e.g.tempeh)

Pits (Arctic regions, Himalaya) – starchy vegg, cabbage - > food preservation

**Other gizmo**

Pickle presses (juicing)

Cider and grape presses

But you can always improvise. With grapes, you can crush them with your (scrubbed) feet in a tub

Grain mill to crack beans for tempeh, grains for porridges and beers

**Alcohol fermentation gizmo**

Slow honey- and fruit-based ferments x faster grain-based ones

Beer makers use an additional vessel called a lauter-tun, which filters the liquid wort extraction from the grains 
after mashing.

Transfer alcs by siphoning (e.g. racking tube, just suck the alc and transfer to another vessel) -> the advantage of 
iphoning is that you can leave behind the sludge of dead yeast (called lees in wines and saké; trub in beers) 
that accumulates at the bottom of the fermentation vessel.

The lees are edible and nutritious, but we have developed a cultural preference for clarified beverages, and many people 
prefer to minimize the yeasty flavor the lees impart.

Steamers - Many of the Asian fermenting grain-based alcoholic beverages require grains or soybeans to be steamed above 
water rather than boiled in water – e.g. stacking bamboo steamers, steam in a pressure cooker

Incubation chambers – keeping high temperature - historically, people have incubated these near heat sources, wrapped in blankets, or even by taking them to bed and using the body to keep them warm / today: oven, breadmaking machine etc.

Curing chambers – for cooler temperatures for a long, slow curing period (e.g. cheeses and dry-cured meats)
-wine fridges

**Bottling**

- corked bottles: Beer / Wine / Champagne
- bail-top bottles with rubber gasket best
- cleanliness, not sterility: Sterility is a myth, the alcohol (or acidification) is its own protection.
- so long as it is kept from prolonged access to oxygen, which would spur vinegar production, it will be okay
- wash bottles with dish soap and hot water. Be sure to rinse well. Boil caps or
plastic corks
- both plastic and wooden corks are ok

always label your ferments!
