Fermented milks:

Developed to preserve milk against spoilage

fermented milk products are said to originate from the Middle East and the Balkans (cca more than 10 000
years ago)

Most fermented milks are made from cow’s milk, but sheep, goat, buffalo, and horse
milks are also used.

Fermented milks may be classified by starter culture and the type of fermentation involved, as follows:
a) Lactic fermentation:
- mesophilic or thermophilic (mesophilic means that the starter is cultured at room temperature / thermophilic means the 
starter is heat-loving, and cultures at around 110ºF, in a some electric appliance, e.g. yogurt maker)
b) Fermentation by intestinal bacteria
c) Yeast – lactic fermentation
d) Mold – lactic fermentation

I. Mesophilic Fermented Milks
The main acid-producer is Lactococcus lactis

e.g
Buttermilk - made from either skimmed milk or milk with a fat content of 0.5–3.0%. The milk is fermented by a starter composed of Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides

Ymer is a Danish traditional fermented milk

Lactofil is a traditional Swedish fermented milk

Kule naoto is a traditional lactic fermented milk of the Maasai community in Kenya

Kefir - traditional product of the Caucasus that is made from all types of milk (cow / ewe milk most often). 
Traditionally, fresh milk was fermented in goatskin bags and hung in the house during the winter and outside during the summer.

starter: grains (“cauliflower”) or powder + milk -> grow kefir
grains are a gelatinous mass harboring a generous variety of bacteria and yeast from which one can make continual 
batches of kefir.

The lactic microflora of ‘grain starter’ consists of Lactococcus lactis, homofermentative and heterofermentative 
lactobacilli (15 species), Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Streptococcus thermophilus

During incubation, microorganisms from grain are shed into the milk and ferment it. For
commercial-scale fermentation, heat-treated (95 C, 10–15 min) skimmed milk is fermented at 18–22 C using kefir grains, 
which are then sieved out.
But kefir is mesophilic and fermentation starts already at 20-25 C

criteria = time, nr. of grains -> influence consistence (density) and flavor

How to make kefir:
-grains to milk: 1:5 (20-30 g of kefir grains for 3dl cup of milk)
-glass / plastic jar (low PH of mature kefir – reactive -> toxins)


II. Thermophilic Fermented Milks
The thermophilic lactic acid bacteria involved in the production of yogurt and yogurt-like products are Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii

Yogurt
-has been developed in eastern Mediterranean countries over thousands of years

how: fermentation of cow milk by a defined microflora, which consists of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii

Most often cow milk, but goat milk can also be used to make yogurt.
Sheep milk is traditionally used to make yiaourti in Greece

The fermentation takes place at 42 C for 3 h,

III. Fermentation by intestinal bacteria
The intestinal bacterial strains used in starters are lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and enterococci - called probiotics.

Probiotics are defined as ‘mono- or mixed cultures of live microorganisms which, when are applied to animal or man, 
beneficially affect the host by improving the properties of the indigenous microflora’

Reason to use them: Therapeutic purposes

-> Acidophilus Milk - a nontraditional product, made from cow milk by fermentation with Lactobacillus acidophilus isolates from the feces of healthy humans.

Examples:
Yakult - a product of Japan and the Eastern Hemisphere, made using L. paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain Shirota), 
which behaves in the human gut in a way that is similar to L. acidophilus and bifidobacteria.

Calpis, Vitagen

Bioghurt (Streptococcus thermophilus), Biogarde (S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus), and Bifighurt (B. bifidum.)

‘Biokys’ - is the trade name of a product of the former Czechoslovakia, which is made from cow milk. 
It is a mixture of two fermented milks.

IV. Yeast–Lactic Fermentations

Examples:
Koumiss (Airag) - This is a traditional product of Mongolia, Tibet, and Russia that is made from mare’s milk.

Skyr - This is a traditional product of Iceland that is made from skimmed ewe’s milk.

Suusac - It is a traditional fermented milk of Kenya that is made from milk of camel.

V. Mold–Lactic Fermentations

Examples:
The Finnish product ‘viili’

Strained Yogurt "Lebaneh" - This is manufactured in the Middle East and neighboring countries by straining natural yogurt, 
usually using a cloth bag, over periods of several hours. It is named differently in different countries, for example, 
‘strangisto yiaourti’ in Greece, ‘torba’ in Turkey, ‘labnah’ in Saudi Arabia, and ‘labneh’ in Lebanon. 
Strained yogurt is used in Greece to make ‘tzatziki’
